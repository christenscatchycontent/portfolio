			<h2 class="align-center blue">About Christen</h2>
<p class="align-center blue"> I have a few hobbies includuing sports, photography, and furniture refinishing. I really enjoy anything I can learn from or create and am always looking for something exciting to do. After finishing school and becoming a mom at a young age, I quickly learned how to multi-task in order to succeed.  I've enjoyed working for a court system, but I have always had a desire to learn how to be a developer. I would be the go-to girl to fix computer issues, and have always loved technology and video games. Now I'm excited to be a student at Thinkful, and am more than ready to tackle what I need to in order to succeed. 
        If you are here because you'd like to hire or work with me, you're making the right move! I'm happy to help. </p>
